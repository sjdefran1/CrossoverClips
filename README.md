## Find your Matchup

CC's currently provides two different ways for finding the game you are looking for.

### Find by single team, or by matchup

By Team Search

- Select just one team to brows all their games since the 2014-15 season.
- Select two teams to filter down by only matchups between the two

Filter results

- Request only the seasons you want, returns all by default
- Filter by playoff games vs regular season
